# ðŸ§  Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to my Project Euler solutions repository! This repo contains my personal solutions to various mathematical and programming challenges from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Why This Project?

I've always been fascinated by how **mathematical insights** can lead to **efficient code**.  
This project is an exploration of that intersectionâ€”learning how to use logic, algorithms, and Java to solve intriguing problems.

Through this repository, I'm strengthening both my **Java programming skills** and **mathematical thinking**.
