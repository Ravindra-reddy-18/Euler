# Project Euler Problem 11 ‚Äì Largest Product in a Grid

This Java program solves **[Project Euler Problem 11](https://projecteuler.net/problem=11)**: *"What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in a 20√ó20 grid?"*

## üßÆ Problem Statement

Given a 20√ó20 grid of numbers, find the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction:
- Horizontally
- Vertically
- Diagonally (left-to-right and right-to-left)

## üìÅ File Structure

- `Problem11.java`: Main Java file that parses the grid and calculates maximum products in all directions.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Parses the input grid from a single multiline string.
- Calculates:
  - Maximum horizontal product
  - Maximum vertical product
  - Maximum left-to-right diagonal product
  - Maximum right-to-left diagonal product
- Prints the highest product among all directions.

## Build  with:
- Java 8+
- Standard Java collections (List, ArrayList)
