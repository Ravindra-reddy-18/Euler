# ProblemTwo - Even Fibonacci Numbers Sum

## Description

This Java program calculates the sum of all even-valued Fibonacci numbers that are less than a given maximum value. Specifically, it solves a version of **Project Euler Problem 2**, where the maximum limit is `4,000,000`.

## Features
- Efficient Fibonacci sequence generation
- Summation of even Fibonacci numbers only
- Demonstrates bitwise operations in Java

## Customization

- To customize the answer to a different limit, edit the method call with your desired limit
- To calculate the sum of odd fibannoci values, edit the if statement to if((c&1)==1)
